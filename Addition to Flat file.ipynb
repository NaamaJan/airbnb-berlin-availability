The room is large and clean but it was not very homey and cozy. Overall I would still recommend this place and Can is a very cool host although we rarely interacted with him###Bright Room is really great. I had a wonderful stay there. Confortable, very clean, spacious, and sunny. The building is also great: friendly and very quiet. Can is a great host, helpful and welcoming. The neighborhood, and Lychener Stra, are incredible: cheerful, wonderful, cool, full of bars and restos, and really near to public transportation (only three stations to Alexander Platz). Also very safe at night. I don't travel very often and I think I was lucky to spend 7 days here. Definitely I recommend Brigh Room. Hope I can come back sometime. ###Bright room was a wonderful place to stay, it's clean and sunlit with two high windows overlooking a tree-filled backyard. I only stayed for a few days and was rarely in the apartment (sight-seeing), but I would have been happy to stay much longer. Can was a wonderful host and gave me a great recommendation for an art-gallery opening my first night which turned out to be really nice event.&#x0D;\n",

We really enjoyed our staying in his place and hope will stay again in the future. ###Can was very kind from the beginning.

Close to so many activities in Berlin. I will definitely stay there again in the future.###Can`s place is very well connected with lots of things.

Can was helpful and relaxed also.###Can's apartment is very well situated in the Prenzlauer Berg area of Berlin. Not only is the immediate area very lively with lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance, it's also close to the Elbestrasse U-Bahn station. The room itself is large, bright and airy - perfect for getting some rest after a long day of walking. And I can see why Can is a super host: He responded quickly to my messages, was able to accommodate my early check-in, and was available if I needed any info or tourism tips. I felt very comfortable in his apartment and would stay here again.###Can's place is great. The location is good, in a trendy neighbourhood, very close to the U-Bahn network, on a street with lots of caf��s, shops and bars. The room itself though is very quiet and peaceful as the apartment is set back from the street. Everything was exactly as advertised: the room is spacious and clean and nicely decorated, Can provided coffee-making facilities and a refrigerator for guests' use. I didn't have time to explore but Can &amp; Anya were very forthcoming with suggestions for the local area, and very welcoming. I would definitely stay here again.###Can's place is in a great, hip location close to public transit. The home is quiet and comfortable, with a fridge and coffee for guests which was a nice touch. I was out and about most of the time so I only saw Can when I arrived, but he was hospitable and had a good knowledge of things in the area. There was no locking mechanism on the bedroom door, but I felt safe in the home and area.###Can's place is not just an apartment, but a work of art! Everything went smoothly and wonderfully, I very much enjoyed the energy of the space and Can is an extremely kind and helpful host. Thanks so much!###Can's place was awesome! I felt bad because the flight was an hour later so I was running behind and kept him waiting, but he was very gracious about it. The place was just great, and he went above and beyond by letting us use his clothes washer. Would stay again!###Can's place was beyond perfect! The neighborhood is centrally located and beautiful. I had some friends in town working for a Berlin-based-company &amp; they consistently (coincidentally) planned excursions right down the street from Can's place! As a person himself, Can is also, beyond awesome. Sweet, welcoming, helpful, interesting, super cool to talk to...he literally made my first Berlin experience exceptional. Also, his place is decorated super nice &amp; has GREAT VIBES! Would totally recommend to anyone!###Can's place was large and spacious. It is conveniently located just 5 mins away from the train and tram stops. Can was also very accommodating of my late check-in, and made sure i felt at home. The room and bathroom were also very clean. Overall, i would highly recommend Can's place to travellers would want a more local experience.###Can's place was lovely, the room was so spacious and clean.

      "###Had a good stay in Can's apt! The apt is in a great location. Close to metro stop and lots of restaurants and cafes to choose from. The apt is as described in the photos and very clean. Coffee and tea are provided. Thank you Can! ###Had a good stay with Can. All worked out smoothly and I would surely come back. ###Had a great overall experience - host was friendly and accommodating, apartment is in a very bustling, hip area, and the pictures are very accurate in representing the room. Minimally furnished, but very clean and simple. My friend and I were very comfortable. The room looks out onto a beautiful, lush courtyard - not a bad thing to wake up to. There are a surprising number of restaurants and bars within half a block of the apartment, and it's right next to the tram, so getting around the city is very easy. ###Had a great stay at Bright Room. Cat is a really nice guy and the apartment was super clean. Great location, as well.###Had a great time in Berlin!  Can's place was perfect in every way...location and amenity.  Unfortunately I didn't get to spend much time with Can -our schedules never seemed to cross paths but I have no hesitation in recommending the Bright Room.###Had an awesome and uncomplicated stay! Would definitely recommend!###Hele fijne kamer, in een heel fijn appartement, bij een hele goede gastheer, op een prachtige locatie in Berlijn. Ik was heel tevreden. De kamer is groot, alles is heel schoon en goed verzorgd, Can Henne was erg aardig. Ik kom hier graag terug en beveel het van harte aan. De beste kamer die ik ooit heb gehad!###Highly recommend staying here with Can in P-Berg. I stayed in two different locations during my time in Berlin, starting in city-center and moving to P-Berg for the later part of my trip. I found that it was much easier to relax and unwind at Can's place. The apartment was sparkling clean and the room is very private and nice. The apartment is in a great neighborhood - clean and safe with a good mix of cafes, cocktail bars, and restaurants. Will definitely stay again if I return to Berlin.###I absolutely loved this place! It was everything stated in the description: quiet, light and spacious with a lovely view to the garden courtyard. Host was helpful, available and respectful.###I could not have asked for a better place to stay in Berlin. the room is lovely and Bright as it says and Can the owner is a very intelligent, cultured and friendly host.&#x0D;\n",

I found the area wonderful with its leafy roads, restaurants, market and easy access by public transport everywhere in Berlin and as a single woman very safe at night.  I was very glad to have chosen this room in this area which gave me a good idea of life in Berlin.  Would definitively recommend it to others.###I had a fantastic stay at Can's place. The room was much larger than expected and extremely clean and quiet. Can was an extremely kind, helpful and engaging host who will always go out of his way to help in any way he can. Location was great. This area is a great old east Berlin area, full of bars, great cheap restaurants and cool shops. It was perfect for my stay of 3 days. I will be staying there again if possible in the future. Thanks Can. Was great to meet you and I look forward to meeting again the next time! ###I had a great 2-night stay at Can���s place.

I was just moving to Berlin and using Bright Room as a stop over while looking for a longer term place. The apartment is in a great location, a good balance between fun and cozy. It was the perfect place for me to do the work I needed to do, and still get out and see the city. The place was super clean, and the host made me feel very comfortable.

      "Thanks for everything.###I was supposed to stay in the Bright Room but we made last minute changes and I stayed in the Bliss Room. I did see the Bright Room and it deserves its name: it's spacious and bright. Just like the Bliss Room deserves its name - spacious, cosy and quiet, it's an absolute bliss! The apartment is in a beautiful old building, its rooms look on the courtyard and if you happen to wake up in the middle of the night for no reason, like I did, take the opportunity and enjoy the absolute silence. Plus, it's the details that count - there were fresh flowers in the hallway/corridor and in my room! If I happen to revisit Berlin, I'd most definitely stay in one of Can's rooms. ###I would like to recommend anyone who thinks of staying here. The room is very comfy and spacious, and also very clean. It is just a little too bright if you're not an early riser. Can it's very kind and responsive and it was very easy to schedule check in time.

The apartment is bright, open, accessible to public transit and only a short walk from great bars, restaurants and shops. It's everything you need as a solo traveler or a couple. Kreuzberg is a good neighborhood if your top priority is partying; but Can's neighborhood is a great spot for a balance between all sorts of cultural activities.

A friend recommended that I look for an AirBnB in Prenzlaur Burg, a hip artistic area of Berlin. Can's apartment did not disappoint. The room is as described, clean and with beautiful natural sunlight and an abundance of lightning for the evening hours. My stay overlapped with 2 sets of guests, whom Can introduced me too, allowing me someone to explore the city with. The location is fairly easy to find from the airport and great for using public transit. I LOVED exploring all the artist store fronts and couldn't believe how easy it was to find delicious vegan/vegetarian cuisine. The neighborhood felt safe at all hours, quite but usually someone else around. I certainly felt as though I was among the locals during my stay and appreciate the hospitality.###The bedroom is very nice, lightly and calm.&#x0D;\n",

The home is clean, quiet, and welcoming. I had a wonderful visit! ###The room was great, very peacefull, clean and big. We were in the twin bed's room, it was very comfortable. The neighbourhood is full of restaurants, pub and minimarkets. Its a very comunicated place (buses, trams, metros). Can was a very kind host, who respected our privacy. We highly recommend staying at Can's apartment!###The space is expansive, can easily accommodate three people, has tall ceilings, beautiful floors and comfortable beds. Since the host is an artist the interior design is minimal with just the right hint of color using bits of his own work to accent it though there is plenty of unobtrusive furniture for storage, seating and a desk for organizing and computer equipment. Even though there was a cooling tendency outside with occasional rain the two heaters under the windows very subtly warmed the room. The directions to the place from the airport cost me a bus and a subway token instead of an expensive cab ride. It's located close to Alexanderplatz, an important city center, and all the tour bus connections a new visitor to the city could need and the host's graciousness and advice sealed the experience with a fond memory.###This place is a central spot and close to many ethnic restaurants and public transportation. Not as easy for older folk, as it is on the 3rd floor, as noted in their description, but doable. It is a quiet location and Can made us feel safe and welcomed. We were off doing the tourist thing most of the day and did not have much interaction with host or other guests. All in all, a pleasant experience for first visit to Berlin.###This place is clean and cozy and apartment is close to subway station. Really great place! ###This place was very neat and tidy and Bright was very helpful.###This room is really lovely!  It is quiet, comfortable and bright and in a great location with lots of bars, cafe's, shops and transport right at your door step.  A perfect way to introduce yourself to Berlin's charm.  Can and his family (the cat Ginger included!) are very friendly and accomodating.###This room was exactly as advertised���big and bright! You could easily spend all your time exploring the neighborhood in which the apartment is located, Prenzlauer Berg, but it's also conveniently located right next to the U- and S-bahn, making it really easy to explore the city. The host kindly accommodated my early check-in, which I greatly appreciated. Recommend!###This was a fantastic room and stay overall. The room is exactly as pictures, and the living space very clean. Water, coffee and tea were provided for our convenience. The location was great! Located with easy access to city center and airport! The neighborhood was very cute, filled with fun shops and good local restaurants. We loved Bright! He was an extremely responsive when planning the trip and we had no issues when checking in! We absolutely loved our stay and would recommend to anyone! ###This was a great place to stay in Berlin. It is very close to Public Transportation so getting around to see the sights was a piece of cake. Bright was quick to respond with questions prior to my trip and was very flexible with regards to check in. His place was very clean and in a great location (lots of caf��s, shops, restaurants etc.). As a female traveling solo I felt very safe at Bright's place and walking around the neighborhood. The room is very spacious and has a mini fridge as well as coffee and tea which was a nice touch.  ###Toller Gastgeber und super gem��tliches und sauberes Zimmer :-) immer wieder gern!###top location, sehr sauber.

Gerne wieder. ###Alles, hij was speciaal eerder naar huis om ons op te vangen, was vriendelijk en behulpzaam en de ruimte is groot en netjes. ###AMAZING Location.\\n\\nFrankly, the location couldn\\'t be beaten.

A house rule FORBIDS you from peeing standing up, Can will also scold at you when failing to do that. &#x0D;\\n2. The room is VERY BRIGHT. It was so bright, we felt like broad daylight at 5:00 AM. It\\'s kind of hard to sleep that way, so take that into consideration.###Awesome space! Hip and fun neighborhood, friendly host, easy to communicate, private and noise-free, lovely wise zen master cat petrols :) ###Beautiful place, great courtyard view, very chill and comfortable! Convenient to metro, nice cheap cafe nearby (and variety of other restaurants).###Beautiful place, wonderful host! The neighbourhood is awesome. I can highly recommend staying with Can.

Recomended.###Big room in a very animated and easy to reach area of Berlin, &#x0D;\\nwith lots of restaurants around the area, metro, tram and bus right around the corner. But the room itself, is a heaven of quiet.&#x0D;\\nCan is obviously an experienced host. He really made me feel welcomed and at ease. His house rules are easy to follow and matches my wishes of a \"relaxing corner in a busy city\" kind of place to stay. I can only recommend. &#x0D;\\nthanks again Can###Bright Room is located in a very nice neighborhood with lots of bars and restaurants and you can see families moving about. The room is large and clean but it was not very homey and cozy. Overall I would still recommend this place and Can is a very cool host although we rarely interacted with him###Bright Room is really great. I had a wonderful stay there. Confortable, very clean, spacious, and sunny. The building is also great: friendly and very quiet. Can is a great host, helpful and welcoming. The neighborhood, and Lychener Stra, are incredible: cheerful, wonderful, cool, full of bars and restos, and really near to public transportation (only three stations to Alexander Platz). Also very safe at night. I don\\'t travel very often and I think I was lucky to spend 7 days here. Definitely I recommend Brigh Room. Hope I can come back sometime. ###Bright room was a wonderful place to stay, it\\'s clean and sunlit with two high windows overlooking a tree-filled backyard. I only stayed for a few days and was rarely in the apartment (sight-seeing), but I would have been happy to stay much longer. Can was a wonderful host and gave me a great recommendation for an art-gallery opening my first night which turned out to be really nice event.&#x0D;\\nThe neighborhood is quite charming as well, there are a number of cafes, restaurants and bars that all looked promising, but I didn\\'t have time to try them all! There\\'s also a fantastic vintage store down the street and a number of boutiques in the area if that\\'s what you\\'re looking for.&#x0D;\\nAll in all a great stay and I highly recommend Bright Room.###Bright was flexible with the time I arrive so it was easy to plan my schedule for check in day. He gave me the direction and the flat was easy to find. I did not see him quite often but there was no problem communicating with him.&#x0D;\\n About the flat itself, it was very clean and spacious. Everything you need was prepared in the room. I loved the neighborhood and location of it as well!###Brightroom gets hands down 5 stars from me. Nice, large and very quite room in a relaxed and tasteful atmosphere. The host makes you feel very welcome while respecting the guests privacy in a very pleasant and unobtrusive manner. I enjoyed may stay very much and will come back. &#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\nOn top of a comfortable accomodation the location couldn\\'t be better if you want to plunge in this nice part of Prenzlauer Berg. Lots of nice cafes, bars and shop around the corner at Helmholzplatz, Stargarder Strasse oder just over the Danziger Strasse at the Kollwitz Kietz. The room itself though is very quite as it is a typical Berlin rears haus with the sleeping room looking out to a green backyard. &#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\n###Bright\\'s Place is perfect for both a short or a longer stay in Berlin\\'s Prenzlauer Berg. It is ideally located and you almost feel like in a private little hotel.&#x0D;\\nThe room I rented was spacious and quiet.&#x0D;\\nWhat struck me the most was how amazingly clean the whole apartment is. I stood in a lot airbnb-places already and this one here has probably been the cleanest of them all. Respect.&#x0D;\\nWould always come again!###Cam is a fantastic communicator, his place is as lovely as all tall ceiling Berlin apartments, and it\\'s walking distance from lots to eat and see. ###Can and the Bright Room were just as lovely in person as they appear online. I had overpacked for my trip, and Can was nice enough to carry my heavy suitcase up the stairs for me. The room and bathroom were very clean, and the house quiet and safe. The location was excellent. The neighborhood was lively, with great shopping, food, parks and access to the U-bahn (literally a 2 minute walk). I would definitely recommend the Bright Room to anyone traveling either by themselves, or as a couple. ###Can hat mich sehr nett empfangen und es war alles unkompliziert. Das Zimmer war gross, sauber und sehr gem��tlich. Durch die zentrale Lage kam ich rasch ��berall hin.###Can is a great guest! very welcoming and helpful. He knows the area very well and can recommend good restaurants in the neighborhood which is very charming and well located. The room is very pleasant&#x0D;\\nI warmly recommend it###Can is a warm host.  The apartment is spacious and comfortable.  The neighborhood is charming and ideally situated.  I highly recommend the Bright Room.###Can is an amazing host. The room is very warm and inviting, just like Can. This is also a great neighborhood to stay in. ###Can ist ein sehr netter Mensch, er hat sich prima gek��mmert, der Raum ist sch��n, sauber und sehr ruhig gewesen. Die Lage seiner Wohnung ist ideal. Kleine Gesten sind manchmal gro��artig, in diesem Fall eine Flasche Wasser f��r den Gast! Unser Gespr��ch war auch sehr nett, beim n��chsten Mal gerne l��nger. ###Can ist ein sehr offener, netter und authentischer Gastgeber. Die Wohnung ist sauber und ruhig, alles tiptop und an super Lage.###Can war sehr aufmerksam und nett, das Zimmer wunderbar, Bett und Dusche ausgezeichnet. Sogar eine Flasche Wasser auf dem Schreibtisch. Ich habe mich sehr wohlgefuehlt,###Can was a fantastic host, very helpful and is a lovely person. The room looks exactly like the picture and was clean and quiet. I could not have asked for a better experience and would love to stay there again when I am next in Berlin.###Can was a great host,  he was very flexible and helpful throughout my stay. The room is perfectly located, in one of the top areas of town and only a two minute walk from the S-Bahn - walking up in the room is an absolute blessing! You won\\'t hear a single noise except for the singing birds. Highly recommended! Thanks for everything again!###Can was a great host. Very relaxed and friendly. &#x0D;\\nA clean room with two separate beds, a bit different from the picture. The room is light and very quiet. We had no trouble sleeping in.  &#x0D;\\nThe location of the apartment was perfect. Walking distance to the important public transport lines. The neighbourhood Prenzlauerberg offers everything you need for a short stay in Berlin. ###Can was great and very helpful. His apartment was very central and safe. It was a great experience. ###Can was very accommodating of our late arrival time, which we were really thankful for.  The room is just like the pictures, bright and airy and clean. The area is cool and the market on Sunday is great !###Can was very friendly and kindly... he showed all his apartment, which was very nice and clean, how it is on the pictures.  We really enjoyed our staying in his place and hope will stay again in the future. ###Can was very kind from the beginning. The apartment has a pleasant view into the garden between the buildings, is quiet and just a few minutes from the u-bahn station, but there is also plenty of places to go just around the house. Great place to stay if you want to explore the city.###Can, is one of the nicest people I have ever met in the Airbnb community. I gladly and highly recommend him. The place was great! Close to so many activities in Berlin. I will definitely stay there again in the future.###Can`s place is very well connected with lots of things. Subway by 2 min walk, bicycle by 1 min walk, lots of cafes by no min walk :) Very quite, safe and calm neighborhood. Room is enough for 2 people, even 3. Room was clean and lots of lightning. Can was helpful and relaxed also.###Can\\'s apartment is very well situated in the Prenzlauer Berg area of Berlin. Not only is the immediate area very lively with lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance, it\\'s also close to the Elbestrasse U-Bahn station. The room itself is large, bright and airy - perfect for getting some rest after a long day of walking. And I can see why Can is a super host: He responded quickly to my messages, was able to accommodate my early check-in, and was available if I needed any info or tourism tips. I felt very comfortable in his apartment and would stay here again.###Can\\'s place is great. The location is good, in a trendy neighbourhood, very close to the U-Bahn network, on a street with lots of caf��s, shops and bars. The room itself though is very quiet and peaceful as the apartment is set back from the street. Everything was exactly as advertised: the room is spacious and clean and nicely decorated, Can provided coffee-making facilities and a refrigerator for guests\\' use. I didn\\'t have time to explore but Can &amp; Anya were very forthcoming with suggestions for the local area, and very welcoming. I would definitely stay here again.###Can\\'s place is in a great, hip location close to public transit. The home is quiet and comfortable, with a fridge and coffee for guests which was a nice touch. I was out and about most of the time so I only saw Can when I arrived, but he was hospitable and had a good knowledge of things in the area. There was no locking mechanism on the bedroom door, but I felt safe in the home and area.###Can\\'s place is not just an apartment, but a work of art! Everything went smoothly and wonderfully, I very much enjoyed the energy of the space and Can is an extremely kind and helpful host. Thanks so much!###Can\\'s place was awesome! I felt bad because the flight was an hour later so I was running behind and kept him waiting, but he was very gracious about it. The place was just great, and he went above and beyond by letting us use his clothes washer. Would stay again!###Can\\'s place was beyond perfect! The neighborhood is centrally located and beautiful. I had some friends in town working for a Berlin-based-company &amp; they consistently (coincidentally) planned excursions right down the street from Can\\'s place! As a person himself, Can is also, beyond awesome. Sweet, welcoming, helpful, interesting, super cool to talk to...he literally made my first Berlin experience exceptional. Also, his place is decorated super nice &amp; has GREAT VIBES! Would totally recommend to anyone!###Can\\'s place was large and spacious. It is conveniently located just 5 mins away from the train and tram stops. Can was also very accommodating of my late check-in, and made sure i felt at home. The room and bathroom were also very clean. Overall, i would highly recommend Can\\'s place to travellers would want a more local experience.###Can\\'s place was lovely, the room was so spacious and clean. The room faced a courtyard so it was very quiet, and it was only 2 blocks from a train station. I would definitely stay here again! ###Can\\'s room is the nicest place and host you will find in Prenzlauer Berg. Highly recommended!###Chambre tr��s agr��able et tr��s calme dans un quartier plein de caf��s, bars et restaurants.

It\\'s even better than in the pictures. The location is very near to the public transportation, while the neighborhood itself was super cute. Definitely coming back, whenever in Berlin. Loved everything about it :)))###Great place and location###Great place to stay nice and central but still chilled and quiet.

It would be a small gesture if he had provided a coffee plunger as we had to go out and buy one while there.&#x0D;\\nOn second day bathroom plug disappeared, so we tried to contact Host, but he did not answer his door.  So we wrote a note asking where it had gone. Next day a curt note appeared on bathroom door about water usage! Tried again to contact him but no answer.  Horwever he knocked on door when either of us were in bathroom next day.  &#x0D;\\nNot impressed by his lack of courtesy, and we managed to improvise and have our puddle baths despite his harassment.&#x0D;\\nIn my experience many people use more water with long showers.&#x0D;\\n than I  do with shallow puddle bath.&#x0D;\\nWe both felt a discomfort in a house where he just was not prepared to interact with us and we left without seeing him or bidding him good bye.&#x0D;\\nWhen I booked it seems I was charged for only one person and my feeling is that once the extra money was paid to him he wanted no further contact.  No commission was to be paifd to AIirbn&#x0D;\\n###Had a good stay in Can\\'s apt! The apt is in a great location. Close to metro stop and lots of restaurants and cafes to choose from. The apt is as described in the photos and very clean. Coffee and tea are provided. Thank you Can! ###Had a good stay with Can. All worked out smoothly and I would surely come back. ###Had a great overall experience - host was friendly and accommodating, apartment is in a very bustling, hip area, and the pictures are very accurate in representing the room. Minimally furnished, but very clean and simple. My friend and I were very comfortable. The room looks out onto a beautiful, lush courtyard - not a bad thing to wake up to. There are a surprising number of restaurants and bars within half a block of the apartment, and it\\'s right next to the tram, so getting around the city is very easy. ###Had a great stay at Bright Room. Cat is a really nice guy and the apartment was super clean. Great location, as well.###Had a great time in Berlin!  Can\\'s place was perfect in every way...location and amenity.  Unfortunately I didn\\'t get to spend much time with Can -our schedules never seemed to cross paths but I have no hesitation in recommending the Bright Room.###Had an awesome and uncomplicated stay! Would definitely recommend!###Hele fijne kamer, in een heel fijn appartement, bij een hele goede gastheer, op een prachtige locatie in Berlijn. Ik was heel tevreden. De kamer is groot, alles is heel schoon en goed verzorgd, Can Henne was erg aardig. Ik kom hier graag terug en beveel het van harte aan. De beste kamer die ik ooit heb gehad!###Highly recommend staying here with Can in P-Berg. I stayed in two different locations during my time in Berlin, starting in city-center and moving to P-Berg for the later part of my trip. I found that it was much easier to relax and unwind at Can\\'s place. The apartment was sparkling clean and the room is very private and nice. The apartment is in a great neighborhood - clean and safe with a good mix of cafes, cocktail bars, and restaurants. Will definitely stay again if I return to Berlin.###I absolutely loved this place! It was everything stated in the description: quiet, light and spacious with a lovely view to the garden courtyard.

My host was there to welcome me and give me some good information on Berlin.  I found the area wonderful with its leafy roads, restaurants, market and easy access by public transport everywhere in Berlin and as a single woman very safe at night.  I was very glad to have chosen this room in this area which gave me a good idea of life in Berlin.  Would definitively recommend it to others.###I had a fantastic stay at Can\\'s place. The room was much larger than expected and extremely clean and quiet. Can was an extremely kind, helpful and engaging host who will always go out of his way to help in any way he can. Location was great. This area is a great old east Berlin area, full of bars, great cheap restaurants and cool shops. It was perfect for my stay of 3 days. I will be staying there again if possible in the future. Thanks Can. Was great to meet you and I look forward to meeting again the next time! ###I had a great 2-night stay at Can���s place. The apartment is very conveniently  located in the popular Prenzlauer Berg area, dotted with many coffee shops and restaurants. It is close to Eberswalder Stra��e U- bahn station and therefore it is very easy to travel around the city. \\nCheck-in and check-out was smooth. \\nThe apartment is spotlessly clean and the room is very spacious and bright with all amenities and a comfortable bed ��� everything exactly as in the pictures. There were guides and maps which was very helpful. The small fridge in the room was also quite useful.

I arrived a lot earlier than agreed and he was able to meet me immediately. He was very friendly and helpful. I had two great nights sleep and felt comfortable and safe.

And, there\\'s a charming view out to the Garden! I was just moving to Berlin and using Bright Room as a stop over while looking for a longer term place. The apartment is in a great location, a good balance between fun and cozy. It was the perfect place for me to do the work I needed to do, and still get out and see the city. The place was super clean, and the host made me feel very comfortable. I would highly recommend this room to anyone (or a couple) staying in Berlin! ###I have stayed in Bright room for 4 nights. Everthing was exactly as advertised. Can is a very good host and very helpful.\\n\\nThere is another room in the apatment for rental. There was a couple staying at the same time. We were sharig the bathroom with them but there were no issues.\\n\\nGuests are not using the kitchen at home. Can provides coffee, tee and a small fridge in the hallway but I have never used them.\\n\\nThe apartment is on a very good and safe location. It is close to subway and not far to Berlin\\'s most popular attractions. If you like walking you don\\'t need to take the subway.\\n\\nThere are plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes in the neighborhood. Prices are in general affordable. I only had breakfast in the area and not had dinner. But I tried some nice bars around and I enjoyed it.\\n\\nI recommend the place and if I go Berlin again, probably I will stay in Bright Room.###I only saw Can when I arrived.

Thanks Can!###I spent 3 weeks in this lovely neighborhood of Prenzlauerberg.&#x0D;\\nCan is a great and really friendly host.&#x0D;\\nThe bright room is so quiet, luminous and clean.&#x0D;\\nI definitely suggest and recommend Can���s accommodations&#x0D;\\nGreat experience !&#x0D;\\nThank you !&#x0D;\\n###I was stay very comfortable.\\nAs I took a walk every day, I felt cozy around, and the view in the room window was really beautiful.\\nThanks for everything.###I was supposed to stay in the Bright Room but we made last minute changes and I stayed in the Bliss Room. I did see the Bright Room and it deserves its name: it\\'s spacious and bright. Just like the Bliss Room deserves its name - spacious, cosy and quiet, it\\'s an absolute bliss! The apartment is in a beautiful old building, its rooms look on the courtyard and if you happen to wake up in the middle of the night for no reason, like I did, take the opportunity and enjoy the absolute silence. Plus, it\\'s the details that count - there were fresh flowers in the hallway/corridor and in my room! If I happen to revisit Berlin, I\\'d most definitely stay in one of Can\\'s rooms. ###I would like to recommend anyone who thinks of staying here. The room is very comfy and spacious, and also very clean. It is just a little too bright if you\\'re not an early riser. Can it\\'s very kind and responsive and it was very easy to schedule check in time. The location is great, close to public transportation and also a walking distance from good restaurants and bars.###It was a pleasure to stay at this room&#x0D;\\nEverthing works well&#x0D;\\nThanks a lot for everything&#x0D;\\n###It was a very convenient location, and the house is as described in the pictures. The host is good and gives you your space, it\\'s a beautiful neighborhood, vibrant and so much activity around.&#x0D;\\nThe room is well kept and clean, with basic amenities provided. ###It was a very nice accomodation. Room was exactly how it was described. Clean, bright, quiet room and bathroom. We woke up with bird singings. Hennen is a kind,calm and helpful host. I really recommend his room. ###I���ve stayed in Airbnb���s all over. This place is a gem. Clean, well positioned, lovely open space. 10/10. You won���t regret staying here###J\\'ai beaucoup aim�� r��sider dans  cet endroit! La chambre est situ��e dans un quartier tr��s agr��able ( super safe y compris le soir car beaucoup de restaurant avec des terrasses  anim��es) la chambre donne elle,sur une cour arbor��e , donc silencieuse !&#x0D;\\nLe tram+U-Bahn ( Metro)sont �� 2 pas!&#x0D;\\nSi vous avez besoin de quoi que ce soit, Cann est adorable et disponible pour vous renseigner ou discuter ..;-)&#x0D;\\nPersonnellement la prochaine fois que je vais �� Berlin, j\\'y retourne !!!&#x0D;\\nAh , et j\\'oubliais , c\\'est nickel!&#x0D;\\nLa salle de bain , tout!!###Listing was very accurate. Felt very comfortable and welcome. Cam respected my space and I felt right at home!###Loved Bright Room and would definitely recommend it (in fact, I already have). Cam is a great friendly host and the location can\\'t be beat- in an adorable neighborhood and close to public transportation.###Loved our stay! Can is a great host and has suggestions for anything you are interested in. His place is extremely clean and peaceful in a great area of Berlin.

Will most likely come back again. ###Lovely stay at Can\\'s appartment, thank you! The room was very clean and inviting, the apartment was charming and on a personal note I really enjoyed the atmosphere and decoration. The location is ideal (very central in prenzlauer berg, close to many cute restaurants and bars and shops) and I soon realized how lucky I was to have found this place! I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family, and will come back! Can was very nice and helpful, a great host, so in all a perfect stay. Thank you! ###Mein Berlin-Aufenthalt bei Can war spitze. Die Wohnung befindet sich mitten im Prenzlauer Berg: Bars, Cafes, Restaurants, Kneipen, Shopping, alles direkt ums Eck.&#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\nDer \"Bright Room\" ist supergro��, hell (2 gro��e Fenster), gem��tlich und bietet sehr viel Platz in Regalen und Schr��nken. Der Raum liegt ruhig im Hinterhof. &#x0D;\\nCan ist ein freundlicher, unkomplizierter und hilfsbereiter Host. Ich werde beim n��chsten Berlin-Trip auf jeden Fall wieder versuchen in diese Wohnung zu kommen. ###MOLTO BELLO!!&#x0D;\\nCan\\'s home is nice, clean, sunny and quiet.&#x0D;\\nBeautiful place to stay.&#x0D;\\nCan is welcoming and helpful with everything, a modern gentleman :-)&#x0D;\\nWe felt confortable.&#x0D;\\nWe definitely sugget Can\\'s accomodations.&#x0D;\\n###My daughter and I had a wonderful visit to Berlin and staying in Can\\'s apartment certainly added to the experience. Great neighborhood, high quality and affordable food and drink right at your door. Super easy access to public transportation. Only wish we could have stayed longer. ###My daughter, Anya, and I enjoyed or stay in Bright Room very much. Can was very hospitable, and we felt as though we were staying with olds friends. The room was spacious, clean, and as the name connotes sunny and bright. We highly recommend Bright Room to other travelers, and wish Can and his family all the best. Thank you for making our stay in Berlin so pleasant.###My friend and I had a great time - Can helped us out by waking up early and letting us in since we arrived very early in the morning. It was much appreciated! He was very friendly, but gave us our privacy. ###Nice and clean in nice neighborhood###Perfect host &amp; appartment, as described. But always come back. \\nAlso, the host proofs once more that the human behind the appartment makes a huge different. Thank you for your kindness, help and support through the stay. Faith in humanity restored. ###Room was far more spacious then I would���ve imagined and is in a great location! 10/10###Room was great, perfect for two persons. Location was amazing and close to city centre by train, underground or tram.

Naheliegend im zentrum und sehr gute verbindungen zum ��ffentlichen verkehr auf jeden fall empfehlenswert###Sehr netter Gastgeber. Die Wohnung liegt sehr ruhig im Hinterhaus. Man hoert ausser Vogelzwitschern praktisch nichts. Meine Wohnung Zuhause ist lauter. Das Zimmer war schoen eingerichtet. Mir hat es an nichts gefehlt. Die S-Bahn ist nur 5 Minuten entfernt. Top!###Sehr ruhig im Hinterhaus gelegen, sehr angenehme Gastgeber, sauber, bequemes Bett, schlichtes Setting. F��r mich wunderbar.###Spacious and clean room in very nice area of Berlin.

Bright was nice and helpful during our stay and communication all went smoothly. Happy to recommend this place.###Stayed here for 4 weeks while working nearby at the Kulturbrauerie. The commute was 3 minutes of walking. I had a great stay. The room is bright, as it is titled. It is also very clean and spacious. &#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\nCan is a great host, he is friendly and respectful. There is also a super cute cat, Ginger, who sometimes stops by to say hi. &#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\nThe neighborhood is  also fantastic, with imbiss and restos, bars and shops. Super close to the U-Bahn. On Saturdays there is a wonderful farmers market a few blocks south and the epic Floh Market at Mauer Park on Sundays.&#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\nI would recommend this place to anyone who wants a great stay, with chill host in Prenzlauer Berg.&#x0D;\\n###Stayed there for a few days. Eveeything comfortable and clean. Very nice neighbourhood. Can is very friendly and chill###Staying at bright room was realy nice and confortable. The room is full of light, clean and it is in a beautiful (Website hidden by Airbnb) , the host, is sweet and kind,discreet and available. we feeled the sensation to be at a friend\\'s house and we thanks for it.Cristina and Amelia###Staying at Can\\'s place was one of the best decisions of my trip to Berlin. The apartment is bright, open, accessible to public transit and only a short walk from great bars, restaurants and shops. It\\'s everything you need as a solo traveler or a couple. Kreuzberg is a good neighborhood if your top priority is partying; but Can\\'s neighborhood is a great spot for a balance between all sorts of cultural activities. And I feel so lucky to have spent time with Can. He\\'s a truly considerate, generous, and alert individual. Thanks for those few great meals and conversations! ###Staying here was incredible! Can is welcoming, friendly, and easy to talk to. He puts a lot of effort into making his place clean and ensuring you enjoy your stay. The apartment is spacious and lovely. I absolutely love the neighborhood-you have such a variety of caf��s and restaurants to choose from. The apartment is very close to the metro stop. I would definitely stay here again!###super clean and light spacious room and great vibe :-)###Super clean, great location -- perfect for my short stay.###Super experience staying in a great room located in a great neighborhood.

La communication se fait facilement, bref, super!  ###Super! War sehr angenehm!###Thank you very much! We had an awesome time in Berlin. The room was really beautiful and very comfortable!Can is a gorgeous host! I hope will see us again.###The apartment was just what I needed for my trip to Berlin. A friend recommended that I look for an AirBnB in Prenzlaur Burg, a hip artistic area of Berlin. Can\\'s apartment did not disappoint. The room is as described, clean and with beautiful natural sunlight and an abundance of lightning for the evening hours. My stay overlapped with 2 sets of guests, whom Can introduced me too, allowing me someone to explore the city with. The location is fairly easy to find from the airport and great for using public transit. I LOVED exploring all the artist store fronts and couldn\\'t believe how easy it was to find delicious vegan/vegetarian cuisine. The neighborhood felt safe at all hours, quite but usually someone else around. I certainly felt as though I was among the locals during my stay and appreciate the hospitality.###The bedroom is very nice, lightly and calm.&#x0D;\\nThe house is very well located in a cozy and central area. Many restaurants and bars in the area and very close to the metro.&#x0D;\\nCan is very friendly and takes care to bring the host a very nice stay.&#x0D;\\nAll in all, I would recommend to anyone who visits Berlin!###The communication with Can was perfect. &#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\nAnd so was the room.  I expected however something like a kitchen, but there was no (shared) kitchen.  This was my own fault; I didn\\'t read the description good enough.&#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\nWe were glad that Can gave us an extra key.  We were with two persons and with a second key we had more liberty to make our individual plans.&#x0D;\\n###The location of the flat is perfect to start discovering berlin. Around are many restaurant, bars and caffe to find and Prenzlauer Berg is one of the most enjoyable part of Berlin. The flat is located in a silent backyard, and you feel relaxed, if you come back from a long sightseeing tour. The room was clean, big and bright. I would love to stay there again when I am next in Berlin.  ###The place is nice and quiet, nice neighborhood, beautiful boutiques and shops and markets... I didn���t talk a lot with the host tho, he���s quiet and not so communicative, so if u want a quiet and nice neighborhood, this���s quite nice###The place was clean and easy to access. He was solicitous and helpful. A perfect place for me to stay on my two day exploration of Berlin. ###The place was excellent. The location is good and close to both tram and U-bahn. The room was clean and quiet and the 2 beds were comfortable. The photos of the room were very accurate.&#x0D;\\nMe and my friend had a great stay in Can\\'s apartment and would definitely recommend Bright room.###The property is very close to Eberswalde Strasse U bahn station, the street is lovely, with nice cafes and restaurants. Can lives in a nice building with huge doors, high ceilings and wooden floors. He is very welcoming, super helpful and made us feel relaxed. Can is a really interesting guy and we enjoyed chatting to him a few times throughout our 4 nights stay.&#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\nCan\\'s place is very clean and the room is big. It\\'s very quiet and the windows open on to a garden and you can hear nothing but birds singing in the morning. I would recommend it as a great place to stay in Prenzlauer Berg as it\\'s so central to get everywhere. ###The room and the host were excellent and I would gladly stay again.  There is attention to detail in the hosting process.  The house has a lovely bohemian feel, and the rooms are absolutely immaculate. The bed is extraordinarily comfortable, the hot water is hot, and the washing machine works well.  The host is professional and friendly.&#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\nHighly recommended.###The room Can provided was great, two beds with a desk chairs and plenty of storage. The apartment is extremely clean and large enough that their is some privacy. The neighborhood has a lot of great shops, restaurants and bars and is right next to the public transit. I would recommend this room to anyone staying in Berlin. ###The room is as stated, and very peaceful. ###The room is better than you see in the pictures. It\\'s quiet and it\\'s also a great location for anything you may desire in Berlin. Can is a perfect host: quick and reliable, a very nice person and a very discreet presence. A great place in Prenzlauer Berg.###The room is bright, large and very suitable for two, quiet on a very silent backyard. Near to the U-Bahn and S-Bahn from Schonefeld airport, all around is plenty of bar and pubs to eat food from the world (korea, vietnam, chinese, italia, and Germany as well). Recommended###The room is nice, clean and very quiet. The host is very easy going and friendly. I loved my stay there. And the extra single bed turned out to be very handy. Highly recommended.###The room is perfect, Can is a nice guy... great place!###The room is perfect. A lot of light, very quiet. Big and comfortable. The neighborhood is great full of restaurants, cafes, shops. Well comunicated. I had a great stay. Definitely recomend it !###The room was exactly as described, and my stay was terrific. The home is clean, quiet, and welcoming. I had a wonderful visit! ###The room was great, very peacefull, clean and big. We were in the twin bed\\'s room, it was very comfortable. The neighbourhood is full of restaurants, pub and minimarkets. Its a very comunicated place (buses, trams, metros). Can was a very kind host, who respected our privacy. We highly recommend staying at Can\\'s apartment!###The space is expansive, can easily accommodate three people, has tall ceilings, beautiful floors and comfortable beds. Since the host is an artist the interior design is minimal with just the right hint of color using bits of his own work to accent it though there is plenty of unobtrusive furniture for storage, seating and a desk for organizing and computer equipment. Even though there was a cooling tendency outside with occasional rain the two heaters under the windows very subtly warmed the room. The directions to the place from the airport cost me a bus and a subway token instead of an expensive cab ride. It\\'s located close to Alexanderplatz, an important city center, and all the tour bus connections a new visitor to the city could need and the host\\'s graciousness and advice sealed the experience with a fond memory.###This place is a central spot and close to many ethnic restaurants and public transportation. Not as easy for older folk, as it is on the 3rd floor, as noted in their description, but doable. It is a quiet location and Can made us feel safe and welcomed. We were off doing the tourist thing most of the day and did not have much interaction with host or other guests. All in all, a pleasant experience for first visit to Berlin.###This place is clean and cozy and apartment is close to subway station. Really great place! ###This place was very neat and tidy and Bright was very helpful.###This room is really lovely!  It is quiet, comfortable and bright and in a great location with lots of bars, cafe\\'s, shops and transport right at your door step.  A perfect way to introduce yourself to Berlin\\'s charm.  Can and his family (the cat Ginger included!) are very friendly and accomodating.###This room was exactly as advertised���big and bright! You could easily spend all your time exploring the neighborhood in which the apartment is located, Prenzlauer Berg, but it\\'s also conveniently located right next to the U- and S-bahn, making it really easy to explore the city. The host kindly accommodated my early check-in, which I greatly appreciated. Recommend!###This was a fantastic room and stay overall. The room is exactly as pictures, and the living space very clean. Water, coffee and tea were provided for our convenience. The location was great! Located with easy access to city center and airport! The neighborhood was very cute, filled with fun shops and good local restaurants. We loved Bright! He was an extremely responsive when planning the trip and we had no issues when checking in! We absolutely loved our stay and would recommend to anyone! ###This was a great place to stay in Berlin. It is very close to Public Transportation so getting around to see the sights was a piece of cake. Bright was quick to respond with questions prior to my trip and was very flexible with regards to check in. His place was very clean and in a great location (lots of caf��s, shops, restaurants etc.). As a female traveling solo I felt very safe at Bright\\'s place and walking around the neighborhood. The room is very spacious and has a mini fridge as well as coffee and tea which was a nice touch.  ###Toller Gastgeber und super gem��tliches und sauberes Zimmer :-) immer wieder gern!###top location, sehr sauber. Can ist ein exzellenter Host. immer wieder!!!###Totally as described. Very airy, comfortable room in the heart of a hip--but surprisingly quiet at night--neighborhood. You can party and then get a good night\\'s sleep! \\n\\nAs a woman it felt safe walking around the neighborhood by myself, even after dark. Public transportation--the U-bahn and trans are within a few blocks. I bought a week pass so I didn\\'t have to use a cab for my five day stay. Which is a good thing because my American smartphone was very unreliable in Germany, except at Can\\'s home which has a good wi-fi connection.\\n\\nCan is a very nice, considerate host, and I wouldn\\'t hesitate to stay here again. Thank-you, Can!###Tranquil, quaint and clean. This is a lovely little room to call home. It\\'s exactly as the listing says but better. Beyond the clean, quiet atmosphere of the entire home, the room is big and the bed is comfy. Furthermore the location is absolutely fantastic, and within walking distance to a plethora of outstanding dining and bar options in Prenslauer Berg. Not to mention the U-Bahn and Tram stops are a 5 minute walk, connecting you to central Berlin within 10 to 15 minutes. ###Un lieu parfait pour s��journer �� Berlin, dans le meilleur quartier pour son ambiance et sa vitalit��. Proche du U-Bahn et S-Bahn, la ville est �� port��e de main. \\n\\nLa chambre est calme, donnant sur la cour int��rieure de l\\'immeuble. La propret�� est irr��prochable. Et l\\'accueil est chaleureux et tr��s convivial. \\n\\nUne adresse �� conserver. ###Very convenient location. Can the host is very responsive by email. Most of time didn\\'t see him during our stay so most of the communication was fine through email . Room is spacious, cozy and efficient. ###Very easy and smooth process. I rented the room for my Dad and niece who had never been to Germany before and their experience was very good.###Very good location, silent and spacious room!  Host was friendly and help me a lot. ###Very helpful host and a great area to discover Berlin.  &#x0D;\\nWe recommand it!###Very lovely,light,clean,spacious room where the host is very friendly and helpful. The location is top with alot of parks nearby, easy access to most of the city and alot of great little cafes and restaurants nearby. We will return here if we come back to Berlin.###Very nice room, spacious, cozy and quiet, great location, had everything that you would need. Excellent access to transit. Great area, a lot of caf��s, bars and restaurants around. Can was great too! He is very friendly, inviting and happy to assist with everything you can possibly ask for. Enjoyed my stay immensely and would definitely book again! ###Very nice spot. Great location, pleasant and quiet room and a wonderful host (Can, thank you so much). Strongly recommended. ###Very nice, central and yet quiet. Very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended!###very nice, quiet apartment in the center of P-Berg###We booked the Bright Room in the last minute, Besides the great reviews it received we did not know what we were going into. Because of our Early flight we arrived early in the morning before the check in time, The Owner was kind to let us put our stuff in the apartment and off we went to bike Berlin. The Apartments location is fabulous  right next to the U Ban subway and nearby to many cafe\\'s and restaurants. The Room is located towards an inner courtyard and is very quite. The room  is very clean and well decorated, Can the owner is an Artist and has great taste. The wash room is a shared resource with the owner and the other Room that is rented, this was not an issue for us . The great Shower and clean toilet was more then enough. The Double bed is extremely comfortable I wish I had a bed like that at home.&#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\nGreat experience!###We enjoyed a lot our stay in this luminous and serene room. The Host was a very pleasant and helpful. The apartment is located at less than 5 minutes walking from a subway station and there are a lot of restaurants at very reasonable prices with different cuisines in the neighbourhood (Prenzlauer Berg). This is a place with a lot of young people, children, parks, a book store nearby. We certainly would go back to this place if we return in Berlin.&#x0D;\\nAril Pineault &#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\n###We had a great time at Can\\'s place. The room is huge, the location is great and the flat is very calm. &#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\nAnd Berlin is awesome. ###We really loved the stay in the Bright Room. Superb area with lot of children, nice restaurants and ecological shops. Me and my son, twelve years, rented bikes at the Kulturbrauerai and that was the perfect way to get around in Berlin. There are many play grounds in the area and good possibilities if you like to play football together with new friend while the mother relax with a coffee in a caf�� nearby. Do not hesitate. This is a good place to stay if you like to live like a local and not as a tourist in Berlin. ###Wir haben die Tage in Berlin genossen - die Unterkunft war freundlich und ruhig, der Gastgeber sehr nett. ###Wonderful host. Perfect room. Excellent location.&#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\nThis may have been my favorite AirBnB stay. The room is perfectly clean, spacious, quiet and very comfortable. I made good use of the desk and lounge chair and the bed was great.&#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\nThe location and neighborhood can\\'t be beat. It\\'s so close to countless cafes, restaurants and shops, and just steps from multiple public transit options.&#x0D;\\n&#x0D;\\nCan is very kind and helpful. We had a really nice talk over tea and I made to feel very welcome. He\\'s totally an A+ host, and when I return to Berlin this will be my first choice for a place to stay.###Yes He Can ! Freundlich, sauber, angenehm. Gern wieder.###Yes it was a really peaceful stay'"
